<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>One common method for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the public water supply.</p>
