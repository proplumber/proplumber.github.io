<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>House owners generally give very little thought to their waste disposal unit up until it breaks.

We will likely suggest replacing your garbage disposal with a more recent model if it is leaking from an actual fracture in the device.</p>
