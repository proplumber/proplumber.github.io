This is not just because your plumbing has actually aged with time, however also due to the fact that homes that were developed prior to a specific period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your house was built before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping.
