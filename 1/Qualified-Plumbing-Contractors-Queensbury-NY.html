<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
