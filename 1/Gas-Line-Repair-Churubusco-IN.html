<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis.

Rotate the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal system will need can differ depending on how frequently it's utilized, its age, and the type of items you're putting in it.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
