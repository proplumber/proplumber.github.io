<h3>Water Heater Service in Four Oaks North Carolina</h2>
<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
