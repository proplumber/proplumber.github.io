<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale formation in hard water supply. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well sufficient described to permit others to assess them and to verify the results.

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this might be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may start leaking soon.
