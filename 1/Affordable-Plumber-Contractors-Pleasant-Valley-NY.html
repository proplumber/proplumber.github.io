For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
