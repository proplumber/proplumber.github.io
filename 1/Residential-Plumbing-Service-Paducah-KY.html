<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
