<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
