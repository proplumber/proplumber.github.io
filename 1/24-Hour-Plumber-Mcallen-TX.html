<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
