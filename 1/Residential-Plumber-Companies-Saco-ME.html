Most of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a great idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
