<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
