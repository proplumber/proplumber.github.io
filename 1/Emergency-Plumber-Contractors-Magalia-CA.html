<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
