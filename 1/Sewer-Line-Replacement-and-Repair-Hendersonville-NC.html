<p>This is among the main and very first questions that you need to ask yourself when it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house. The age of your home is an important component to understand whether you need to repipe your house. This is not only because your plumbing has aged with time, but also due to the fact that homes that were built prior to a certain period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was built years prior to that, chances are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>
