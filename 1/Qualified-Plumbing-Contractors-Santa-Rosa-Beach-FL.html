<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply.

Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
