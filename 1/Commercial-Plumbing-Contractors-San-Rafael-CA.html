<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically kept at a significant pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
