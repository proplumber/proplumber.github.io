<p>House owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly sensible to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a brand-new house.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Backflow Preventers are an important part of any plumbing task with the function of keeping drinkable water separate from any prospective hazards through several applications.

In drinkable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic locations with destructive water pollutants.</p>
