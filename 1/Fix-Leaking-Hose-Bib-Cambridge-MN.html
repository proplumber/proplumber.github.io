The system picked for a provided installation should be proper for the system design and site conditions, consisting of consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to take place. Further, it must be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, producer requirements, and engineering standards for the type of system to be utilized.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

One glass of tap water can have a high material of minerals - another glass of faucet water can have a low content of minerals.</p>
