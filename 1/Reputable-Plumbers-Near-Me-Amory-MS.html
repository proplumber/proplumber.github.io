<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company provides include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.
