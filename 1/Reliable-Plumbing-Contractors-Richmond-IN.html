<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with hard water, you may not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Tough water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to utilize more.

The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
