<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
