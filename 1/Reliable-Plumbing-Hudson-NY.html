<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Hudson NY</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
