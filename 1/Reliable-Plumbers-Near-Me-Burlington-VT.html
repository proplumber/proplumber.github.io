This can require the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then go into the drinkable water system.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
