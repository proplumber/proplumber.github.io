<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the cost savings have actually been based mainly on reducing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those cost savings are still significant, brand-new commercial softening innovation using multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides substantial water and salt cost savings.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you might not want just running outside. Not to point out plumbing code may be violated without correct backflow prevention.</p>
