<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable design takes two to three hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater. Positioning the brand-new unit takes roughly 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the brand-new connection points and verify that all functions are up to code.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
