<p>Frequently brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
