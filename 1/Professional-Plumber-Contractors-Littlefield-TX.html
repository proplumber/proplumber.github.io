<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
