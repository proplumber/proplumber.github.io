<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Since it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, hardness can appear as an annoyance when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It also hinders soap and detergent use. Individuals with really soft water can utilize smaller sized amounts of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
<p>When determining the firmness of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is considered incredibly tough water, leaving indicators like spotty glasses and soap scum that is next to difficult to remove. With well water, these signs might also be coupled with iron spots and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>
