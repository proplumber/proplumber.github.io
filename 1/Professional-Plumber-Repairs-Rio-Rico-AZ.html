<p>Include an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting spring-loaded, air inlet valve. Though a sink is a fairly basic system as far as plumbing goes, these components can experience all sort of difficulty. You need a service team that can act quick and with the utmost care, guaranteeing a swift resolution and results that you can trust.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
