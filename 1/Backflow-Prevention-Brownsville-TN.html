<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
