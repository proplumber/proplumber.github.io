Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
