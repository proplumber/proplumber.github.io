<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs many items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated. The installation must be assessed to guarantee it does not prevent the workings of the assembly. Test data need to be collected to identify the workings of each element. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked once again to be sure it was appropriately repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is required to guarantee it was repaired properly. A properly repaired assembly needs to supply years of security.</p>
