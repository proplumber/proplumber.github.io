<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you must only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture moisture so that it doesn't go into the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>

The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
