<p>When the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
