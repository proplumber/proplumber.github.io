<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.
