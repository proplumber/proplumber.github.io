<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not always require a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Soldotna AK 99669!</h3>
<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with difficult water, you might not understand how much it affects you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Tough water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
