<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Stevens Point WI</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
