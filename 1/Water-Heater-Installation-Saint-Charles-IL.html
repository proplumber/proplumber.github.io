<p>You live in an older house. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
