<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
