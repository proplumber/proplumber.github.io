<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
