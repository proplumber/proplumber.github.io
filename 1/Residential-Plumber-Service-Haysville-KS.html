Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
