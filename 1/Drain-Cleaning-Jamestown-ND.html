<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save cash. While this might operate in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the very same product as other pipes in your house, indicating that trouble could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
