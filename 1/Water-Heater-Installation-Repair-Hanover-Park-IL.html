<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
