<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
