<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.
