<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, plans for each device to be set up should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may use up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Rejected plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
