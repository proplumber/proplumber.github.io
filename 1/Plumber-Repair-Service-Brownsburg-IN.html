<p>106.2.2.3 Repairs to Gas Piping. Repairs to gas piping will not be exempt work and will need a permit and inspection. Some units operate from a lightswitch, while others use a push button switch mounted 1 close by. They cost roughly $100 for the whole system, and can be mounted 1 on the counter, sink, or cabinet for benefit.
