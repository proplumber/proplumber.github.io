<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public supply of water and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of security for the public supply of water system.</p>
<p>When it pertains to repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line, there are a few alternatives. The best option for your house will depend upon a couple of aspects, including the age of your existing pipes, the extent of damage, and your spending plan.
