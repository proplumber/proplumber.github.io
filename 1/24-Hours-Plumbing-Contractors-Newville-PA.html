When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your residential or commercial property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason requires to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt manner, the chances are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>

I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
