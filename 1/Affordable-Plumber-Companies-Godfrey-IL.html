When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
