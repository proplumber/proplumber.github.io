<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the home, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
