<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face circumstances, frequently that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
