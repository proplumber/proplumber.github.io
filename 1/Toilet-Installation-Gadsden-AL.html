<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>If left unrepaired, a leaking hot water heater can cause more severe problems. They can also threaten and can lead to mold and even damage to the structure of your home. That's why you should never postpone a repair. A professional plumber will have the ability to properly find the source of the leak and suggest the best option. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater is beyond repair it may be time to think about setting up a new system.</p>
