<p>If you see low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
