<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
