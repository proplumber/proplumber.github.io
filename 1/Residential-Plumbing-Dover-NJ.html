<p>On and off does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally discovered before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This small hole permits water to constantly leak out very gradually. With time it can lead to a significant construct of water. Leaked water typically remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's foundation was not correctly compressed, this can possibly cause a cavity.
