<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it.
