I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
