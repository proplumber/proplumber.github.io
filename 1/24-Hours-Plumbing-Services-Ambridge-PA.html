<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
