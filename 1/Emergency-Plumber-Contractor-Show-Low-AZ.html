<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, including poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older communities where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long enduring and durable, copper is the industry standard.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
