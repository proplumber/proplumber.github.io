If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
