<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a little more costly but are also extremely practical, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in finding buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the level of essential repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Lots of sprinkling systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need only be checked yearly. Others might not meet state and local policies and may need to be changed with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
