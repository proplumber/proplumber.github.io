<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
