Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
