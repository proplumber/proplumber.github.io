<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly basic system, regardless of their importance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the watering line within your company, where watering satisfies the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This makes sure that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems remains detached from clean" water.</p>
