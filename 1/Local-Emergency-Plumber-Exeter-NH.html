<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home.

<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design.

A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must.

Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate choice to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
