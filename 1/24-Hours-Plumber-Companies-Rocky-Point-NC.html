<p>Our plumber teams intend to keep your house and work locations effective, comfy and functional. When it rains, any excess water is supposed to decrease a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your home when it rains, then there is a good chance that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not resolved in a prompt manner, the chances are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>

<p>The best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities site is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV).

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
