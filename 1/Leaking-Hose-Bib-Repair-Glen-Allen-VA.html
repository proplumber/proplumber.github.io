He noted that there are particular impurities that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
