<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak.

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
