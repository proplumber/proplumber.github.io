<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
