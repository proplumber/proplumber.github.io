<p>When the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
