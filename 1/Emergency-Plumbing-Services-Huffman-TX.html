<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Another difference between soft and tough water is dullness of your hair and clothes. If you have difficult water, your hair might feel dull and do not have body, and your clothing will start to fade and might wear previously.

<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might utilize one or a combination of piping product throughout your house repiping task. Copper is standard since it's lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which means greater labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which implies plumbers can flex the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves money and time and minimizes the threat of joint leaks. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending upon your needs.</p>
