<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Northridge CA 91325</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
