<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You have long-term water hardness if you do not see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing detergents not working as effectively or your skin getting scratchy and delicate. If you smell gas, do not attempt to find the leak. Rather, leave your house or structure right away. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a trigger. When you are in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water coming into the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets.

You can also minimize salt, water, and energy by using as much as 50% less detergent for laundry and dishwashing, consuming to 34% less salt and up to 35% less water during regeneration.</p>
