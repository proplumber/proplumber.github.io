Food cleaned down a drain unintentionally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering blockages and gradually damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a garbage disposal wash straight down quickly.</p>

While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
