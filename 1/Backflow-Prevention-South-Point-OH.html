<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Typically handles are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down effectively. It's a simple repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush handle out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the delegated loosen up (Picture 1). Then eliminate the old deal with and lever, slide the new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
<p>It assists to understand the brand and design of your toilet. The trademark name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers in some cases try two or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
