Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
