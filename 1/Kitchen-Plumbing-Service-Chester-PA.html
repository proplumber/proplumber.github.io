<p>The standard water heater has a tank that is filled with constantly heated water. It loses energy by holding the temperature level of water that is not currently in use. Unlike residential swimming pools, public or neighborhood pools need to utilize only RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or neighborhood pool must be tested upon installation and after that annually.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water seems rusty, this could be an indicator that your water heater is rusting on the inside and might start leaking soon. You can look at this by filling a couple of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
