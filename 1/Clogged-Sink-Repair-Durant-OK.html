I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
