<p>Water supplied by the water company consists of some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems get rid of these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional expenses. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement usually will not require surcharges, such as application charges. New meters should meet guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies might require a distinct meter for their services, restricting your options. Layout - Once you add a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will use more materials which contributes to your labor expenses.</p>
