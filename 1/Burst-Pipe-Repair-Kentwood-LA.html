Then, a brand-new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its install. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
