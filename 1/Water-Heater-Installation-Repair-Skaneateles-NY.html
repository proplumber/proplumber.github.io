<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Skaneateles NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
