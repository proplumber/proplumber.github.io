It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly must be checked to determine what is in need of repair.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).
