<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
