<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>There are two main types of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and lowered pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person uses around 80-100 gallons of water a day.
