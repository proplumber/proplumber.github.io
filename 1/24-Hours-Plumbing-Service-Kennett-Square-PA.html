If you're not comfy making electrical connections for your waste disposal unit installation, you can buy a disposal that already has a cable attached. Ask at your house center or home appliance shop, or search online for 'garbage disposal with cable attached.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
