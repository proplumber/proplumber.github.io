<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company provides include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
