<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
