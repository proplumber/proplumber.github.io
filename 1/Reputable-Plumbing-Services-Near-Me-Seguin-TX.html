<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
