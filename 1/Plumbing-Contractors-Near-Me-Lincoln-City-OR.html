Inspecting the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be serious problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation.

<p>Newer designs, such as tankless water heaters, are far more energy-efficient and can help you save on your monthly utility bills.
