<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.

We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can often establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are attached to the kitchen sink.
