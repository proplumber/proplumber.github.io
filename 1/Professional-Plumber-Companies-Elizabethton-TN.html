<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Elizabethton TN</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If your sewer line is clogged or you presume it of being damaged, a digital camera inspection of the pipe is one of the best tools for determining both the cause of the problem, and the area of the issue.
