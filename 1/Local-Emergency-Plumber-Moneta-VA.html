Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
