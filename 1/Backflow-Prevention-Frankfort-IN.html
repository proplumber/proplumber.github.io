The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
