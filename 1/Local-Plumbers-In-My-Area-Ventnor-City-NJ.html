<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in structures are connected effectively, with no cross-connection to infect potable water supply.

The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
