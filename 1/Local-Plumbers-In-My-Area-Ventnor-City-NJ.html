The company need to get a permit before trenching. How often a backflow preventer requires to be evaluated depends on its type.

<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in structures are connected effectively, with no cross-connection to infect potable water supply.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
