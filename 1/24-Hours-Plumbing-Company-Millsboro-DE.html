<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.
