<p>We all experience a clogged drain at some time. You can try to take matters into your hands by using daily products, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some homeowners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.
