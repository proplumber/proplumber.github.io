<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening simply eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain.
