<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the major contributor to the solidity of Woodbury's water. Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, firmness can appear as an annoyance when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It also disrupts soap and cleaning agent use. Individuals with very soft water can use smaller sized amounts of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
