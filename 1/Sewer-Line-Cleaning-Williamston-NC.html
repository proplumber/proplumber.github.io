Examining the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be severe issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your home need to have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working effectively, you are off to an excellent start.</p>

You might have sediment that has actually built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower.
