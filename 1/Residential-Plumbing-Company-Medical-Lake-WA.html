<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread out polluted water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable contaminants or pollutants to go into the potable water system.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
