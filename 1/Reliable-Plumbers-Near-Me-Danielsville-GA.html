Some property owners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are dealing with a little drain clog. Nevertheless, they are usually short-lived repairs that do not use permanent resolutions.</p>
