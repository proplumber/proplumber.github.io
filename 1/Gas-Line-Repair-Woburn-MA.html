A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
