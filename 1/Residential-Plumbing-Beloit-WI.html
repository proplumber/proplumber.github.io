The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
