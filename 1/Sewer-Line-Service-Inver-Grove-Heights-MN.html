A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your brand-new tank flush valve does not work is check for leakages" and make modifications."
