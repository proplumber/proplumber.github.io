<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
