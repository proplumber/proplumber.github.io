<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
