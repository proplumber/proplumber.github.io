<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Copper is the industry standard due to the fact that it is long lasting and durable. We will use you various options based upon your spending plan and preferences. PEX piping is a new choice that is flexible, resistant to deterioration, and up to 75 percent more economical than copper piping.</p>
