<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.

From there we can make a notified decision on whether your issue can be solved by an easy repair or if replacing the waste disposal unit is eventually the much better choice.</p>
