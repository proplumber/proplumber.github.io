<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the potable water system.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>

Under the sink, place a container or pan below the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
