The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
