<h3>Water Leak Repair in Prestonsburg Kentucky</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that ran on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
