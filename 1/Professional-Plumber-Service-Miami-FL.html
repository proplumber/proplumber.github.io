<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller model that operated on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
