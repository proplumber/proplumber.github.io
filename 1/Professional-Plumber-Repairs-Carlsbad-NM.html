<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the proper safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
