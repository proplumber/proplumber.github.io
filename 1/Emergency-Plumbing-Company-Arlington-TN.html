Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
