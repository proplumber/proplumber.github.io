<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
