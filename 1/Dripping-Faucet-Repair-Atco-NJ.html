<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
