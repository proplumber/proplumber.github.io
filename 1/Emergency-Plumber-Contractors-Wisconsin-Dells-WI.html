<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
