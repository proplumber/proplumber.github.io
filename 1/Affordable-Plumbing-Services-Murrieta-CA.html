Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can trigger harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
