<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Stanton CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>If your sewer line is clogged or you believe it of being damaged, a digital camera inspection of the pipe is one of the best tools for determining both the reason for the problem, and the location of the issue.
