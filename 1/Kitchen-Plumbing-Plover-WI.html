<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.
