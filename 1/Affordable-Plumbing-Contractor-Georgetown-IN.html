<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially useful in locating an issue.</p>
