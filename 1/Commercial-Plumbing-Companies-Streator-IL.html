<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Streator IL 61364?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
