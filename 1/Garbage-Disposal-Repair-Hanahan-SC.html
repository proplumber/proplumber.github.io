<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
