<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Saint Marys GA</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

To prevent deterioration from rust, tank are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting destructive products.
