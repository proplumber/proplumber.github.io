<p>Gas is difficult to detect, as it's a colorless, odor free compound. We utilize natural gas in our houses with gas stoves, heaters, and ovens. American homes access natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor devices can take place rapidly and suddenly.
