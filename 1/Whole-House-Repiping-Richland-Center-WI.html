<p>Whether you're dealing with a leaky faucet, a broken toilet or a leaking or burst water line, residential and commercial plumbing problems can really slow you down. The pros at Perez Plumbing have the equipment, experience and understanding to quickly handle any plumbing issue you might have. With years of plumbing contractor experience, our highly trained professionals bring affordable and practical plumbing solutions to home and company owner in the area.</p>
<p>New shower drains create strong seals that are less most likely to loosen over time. A number of options are excellent for tight areas and enable quick installation. If you have a historic home, we can discover a drain that will look good with your existing décor. Procedure the height of your old water heater and purchase a new one the same height so you do not have to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed effectively (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
