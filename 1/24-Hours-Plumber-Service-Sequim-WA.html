It is necessary that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.
