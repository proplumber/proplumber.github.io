These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are one of the most typical indications that your system is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
