<p>Odd Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to go through. Because of the tight space, the pipes frequently make weird gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are available, leading to the odd noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the lawn above it to end up being soggy.
