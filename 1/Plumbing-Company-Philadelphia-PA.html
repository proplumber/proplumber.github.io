<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
