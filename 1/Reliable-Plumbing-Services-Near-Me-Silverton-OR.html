<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
