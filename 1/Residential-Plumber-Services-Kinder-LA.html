<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
