If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
