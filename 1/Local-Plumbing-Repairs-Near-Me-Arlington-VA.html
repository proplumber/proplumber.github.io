<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products consisting of harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
