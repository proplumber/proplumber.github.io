<p>A kitchen sink repair is a common issue in the majority of residential homes. It is among the most pre-owned plumbing component that with time if not looked after might cause a huge problem at the owners cost. As seen on the above picture, there are lots of parts to a kitchen sink. A kitchen sink repair might be as basic as changing a shut off valve or as complicated as fixing the drain assembly to your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
