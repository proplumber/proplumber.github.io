<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Often caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.
