<h3>When To Call A Plumber Honea Path SC</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system may not only save customers cash but might also be eco-friendly, since it helps cut back on damaging cleaning agents going into water streams. In areas where there is very difficult water, customers can typically cut detergent usage in dishwashers and washing devices by more than 50% after softening and get the very same results.</p>
