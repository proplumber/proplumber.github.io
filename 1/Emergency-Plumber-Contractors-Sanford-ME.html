<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
