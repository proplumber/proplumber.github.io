<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping.

This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
