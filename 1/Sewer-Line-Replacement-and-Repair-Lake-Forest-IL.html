Every person I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to assist me through this extremely demanding job. All of individuals I came across were role models for what a well run service organisation should be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>

The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
