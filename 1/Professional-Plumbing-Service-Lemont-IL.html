Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
