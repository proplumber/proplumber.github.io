<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
