<h3>Kitchen Sink Plumbing in Pawleys Island South Carolina</h2>
<p>When making a selection, request evidence of a license. A lot of states require plumbers to be licensed, and they typically provide a number you can call to verify that the license is present and that there are no active grievances versus it. Any plumber you consider ought to also hold an existing employees' compensation policy and a minimum of $500,000 liability insurance.</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a substandard plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
