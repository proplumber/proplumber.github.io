The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home.

A water heater is generally a household device that consists of a gas or electric heating system under a tank in which water is heated and kept. You do not need a plumbing permit for basic repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing authorization is issued as part of a bigger residential building permit or commercial structure authorization.</p>
<p>Some house owners might think of water softeners as a luxury product, something that's nice to have" but not entirely necessary. Nevertheless, hard water can cause everything from minor annoyances, like spots on meals or soap scum, to major problems like a much shorter life-span for your water heater, dishwasher, and other vital home appliances. For these others and reasons, a water softener can be a helpful investment for your house.</p>

Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>
