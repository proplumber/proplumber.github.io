<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. As soon as linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
