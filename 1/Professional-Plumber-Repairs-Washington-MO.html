<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
