<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
