<p>In addition to supplying timely, effective hot water heater repair services, our experienced plumbing service technicians at Huge Blue Plumbing in Alameda, CA, provide full hot water heater installation. Often a repair simply will not look after the problem you're experiencing, while other times the expenditure of the repair isn't worth shelling out on an old hot water heater. Whatever the factor, there are times when purchasing a brand-new water heater ends up being the required choice.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally salt. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
