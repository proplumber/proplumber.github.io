<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Lots of house owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or dirty drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to utilize and affordable, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe creating weak points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses created to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
