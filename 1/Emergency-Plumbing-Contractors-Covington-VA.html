Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
