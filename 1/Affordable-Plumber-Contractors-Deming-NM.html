<p>A Kinetico water softener will offer your family with abundant, clean, safe water as needed. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more conventional method, Kinetico covers all your options. Others bring bags of rocks for putting in your home traps or cleanouts so they are ensured future interruptions in the line.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. This type of camera is specifically beneficial in finding a problem if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
