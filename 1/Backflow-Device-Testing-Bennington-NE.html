When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

That can, in turn, lead to serious headache, fatigue, reduced vision, short breaths, and even loss of awareness. Keep a keen eye on your gas lines, and call professionals for gas line repair in Richmond at the smallest suspicion.</p>
