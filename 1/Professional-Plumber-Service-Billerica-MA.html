<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
