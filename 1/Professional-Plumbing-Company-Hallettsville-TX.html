Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
