<p>The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program established by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program makes use of small installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing authorizations for particular types of minor electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer stopped working inspection due to excessive vegetation. Please trim back your plants and schedule testing with a company from our certified tester list This should be completed within one month to avoid water service interruption.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in 2nd houses eliminates risks of water damage. Standard warm water tanks have threat of leaking, which can cause costly damage repairs, particularly when left unattended.
