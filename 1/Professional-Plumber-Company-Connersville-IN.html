It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
