For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
