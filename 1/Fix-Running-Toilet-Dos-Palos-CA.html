<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
