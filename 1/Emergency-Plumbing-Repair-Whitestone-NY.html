<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your meals that will not disappear, white t-shirts that turn dull and gray after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll more than happy to know that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Hard water triggers these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to fret about any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks much easier and less annoying for everybody included.</p>
