<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this could be a sign that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may begin leaking quickly. You can look at this by filling a couple of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a water heater replacement.</p>
