<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Tolland CT</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
