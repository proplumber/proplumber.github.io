<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
