<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
