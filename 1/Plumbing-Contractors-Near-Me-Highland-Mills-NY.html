<p>Spotty dishes? All Garbage Disposals are not equal. We've dealt with almost every kind on the market today. We understand that the type you pick depends on your area, your cooking practices, your drain lines and your budget. Prior to you decide on a new disposal, provide us a call. We'll inspect your sink area, suggest a brand name and install it. Let our plumbers take a look if your current disposal isn't working. In some cases a little fix can return it to working order.</p>
<p>Inspecting the age, condition, and water lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leakages. If the hot water heater has actually been preserved with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>There are two main types of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and reduced pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a lot of water. In fact, it's a quantity that can send out a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're counting on a out-of-date or broken  hot water heater.</p>
