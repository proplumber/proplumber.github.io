<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through.

Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
