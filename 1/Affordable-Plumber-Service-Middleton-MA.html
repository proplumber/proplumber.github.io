Generally, they start small and go unnoticed, and after time can result in big puddles beneath your sink and kitchen cabinetry. This type results in possible water damage. Many other kinds of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying but are typically fixed quickly.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one instructions.
