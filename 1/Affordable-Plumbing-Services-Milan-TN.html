<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>In some cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This type of circumstance may take place if a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and mistakenly burst a line. A property owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is created by an utility company, it may be covered. The sediment trap parts cost $10 to $14 each and plumbers will have the ability to install it within an hour.</p>
