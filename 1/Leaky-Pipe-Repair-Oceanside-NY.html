<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.
