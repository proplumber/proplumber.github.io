Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
