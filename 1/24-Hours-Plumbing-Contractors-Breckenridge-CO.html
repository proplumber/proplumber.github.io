During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
