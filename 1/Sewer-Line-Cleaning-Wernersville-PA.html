<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

Few house owners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, but managing the job prior to the plumbing system stops working permits you to avoid substantial residential or commercial property damage.</p>
