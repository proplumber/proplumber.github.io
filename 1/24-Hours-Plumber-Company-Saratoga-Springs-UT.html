<p>If you see low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
