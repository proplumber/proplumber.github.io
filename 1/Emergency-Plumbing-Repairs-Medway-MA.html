If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will cause decapitation, it may terrify a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to set up annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you understand that you have a history of obstructing or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will send the outcomes to us. Be sure to find a plumber you trust who will get the job done right at a sensible cost if you need a garbage disposal replacement.</p>
