<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
