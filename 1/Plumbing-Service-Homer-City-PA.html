<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a bit more costly however are also extremely practical, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in finding buried septic systems or examining the condition of buried pipes to identify correct maintenance schedules or the level of needed repairs.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
