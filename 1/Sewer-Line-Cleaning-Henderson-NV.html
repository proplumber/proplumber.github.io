<p>It's a good idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
