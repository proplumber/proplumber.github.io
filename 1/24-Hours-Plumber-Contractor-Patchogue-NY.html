<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's very severe if you wish to truly get the most out of your financial investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
