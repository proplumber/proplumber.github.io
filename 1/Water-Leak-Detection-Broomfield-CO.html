Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check".
