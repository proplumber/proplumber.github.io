<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas devices.

That method, you can quickly tell if you have a gas leak. For the most part, when a garbage disposal system is no longer working, the motor has actually stopped working, and the total cost of the repair will likely go beyond the cost of setting up a brand-new unit.</p>

<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
