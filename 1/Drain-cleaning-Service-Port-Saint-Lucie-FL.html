<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
