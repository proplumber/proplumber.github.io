<h3>Clogged Garbage Disposal in Eatonton Georgia</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
