When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. The pipes often make weird gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with known backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and jacuzzis.
