<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70.
