When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a prospective issue with the hot water heater.
