A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
