<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
