<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
