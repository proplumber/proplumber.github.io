<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
