<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively basic system, in spite of their significance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the watering line within your service, where watering satisfies the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
