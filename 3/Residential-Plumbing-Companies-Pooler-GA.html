Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span.

Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
