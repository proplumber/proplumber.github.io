Ask at your house center or appliance store, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cable attached.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
