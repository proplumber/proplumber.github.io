<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and personal on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of security for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
