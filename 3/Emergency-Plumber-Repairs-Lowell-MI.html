<p>Colored water-- If your hot water appears rusty, this might be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may start leaking soon. You can check on this by filling a couple of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
