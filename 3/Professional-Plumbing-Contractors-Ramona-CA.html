<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.

<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
