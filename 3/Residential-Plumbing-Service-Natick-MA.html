<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
