<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

A plumber will place a specially designed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to determine where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
