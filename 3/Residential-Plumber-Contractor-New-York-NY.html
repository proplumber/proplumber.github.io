<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies New York NY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not position a risk to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
