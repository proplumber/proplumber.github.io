Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
