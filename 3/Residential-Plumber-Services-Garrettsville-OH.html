It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
