<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
