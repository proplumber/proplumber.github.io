<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
