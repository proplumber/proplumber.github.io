<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, sometimes the plumber might have to repair or update circuitry to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or vegetation near the gas leak will be stained or degraded if the gas line is damaged. Contact our specialists to identify the degree of the issue.</p>
