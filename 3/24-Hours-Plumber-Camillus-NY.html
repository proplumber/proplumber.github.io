<h3>Faucet Leaking in Camillus New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
