<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it instantly becomes a major safety hazard.
