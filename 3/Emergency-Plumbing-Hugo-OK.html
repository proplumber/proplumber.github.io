Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are interesting in safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of security on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, however if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. You might need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
