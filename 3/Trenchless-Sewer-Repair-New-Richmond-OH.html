<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
