<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into scenarios, on a regular basis that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd like to publish some photos of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this moment the water is stated to be hard.</p>
