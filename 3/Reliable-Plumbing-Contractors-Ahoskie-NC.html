Soft-close covers and seating so there disappears slamming lids, dual-max flushing systems to prevent blockages permanently, and obviously WaterSense technology guarantees you a green" and high efficiency water saving toilet for your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
