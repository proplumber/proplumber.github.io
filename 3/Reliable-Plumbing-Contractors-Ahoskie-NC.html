Soft-close covers and seating so there disappears slamming lids, dual-max flushing systems to prevent blockages permanently, and obviously WaterSense technology guarantees you a green" and high efficiency water saving toilet for your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too.

Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
