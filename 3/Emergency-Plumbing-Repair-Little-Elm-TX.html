<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
