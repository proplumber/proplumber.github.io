<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
