If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades before that, opportunities are that your house might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to flow backward into city water materials.</p>
