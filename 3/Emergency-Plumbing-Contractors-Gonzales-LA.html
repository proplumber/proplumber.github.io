<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit must not leak. It typically shows wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this happens.
