Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
