<p>Irrigation backflow devices are created for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the drinkable water system.

<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
