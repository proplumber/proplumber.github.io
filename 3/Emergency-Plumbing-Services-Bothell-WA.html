<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
