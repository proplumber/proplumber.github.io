<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal units may cost more when they have to match local water and sewer capabilities. The plumbing in your home need to work well or backup can happen, and septic systems might need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
