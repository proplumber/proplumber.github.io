<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>

When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy much healthier skin and hair.
