<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that opportunity.

Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
