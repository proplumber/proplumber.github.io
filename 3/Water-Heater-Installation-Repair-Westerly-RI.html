At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction effect and draw potential impurities into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are commonly found in many houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
