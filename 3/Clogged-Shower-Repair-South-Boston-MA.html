As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through.

This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes solidity minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
