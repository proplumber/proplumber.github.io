<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.
