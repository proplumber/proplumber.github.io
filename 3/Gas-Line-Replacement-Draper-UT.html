The pipelines supply water for entire neighborhoods in addition to large commercial, residential and industrial complexes.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
