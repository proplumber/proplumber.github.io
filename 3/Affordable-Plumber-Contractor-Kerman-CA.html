<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70.
