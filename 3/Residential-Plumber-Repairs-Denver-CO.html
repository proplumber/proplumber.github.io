<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for residents. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
