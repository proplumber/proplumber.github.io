For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
