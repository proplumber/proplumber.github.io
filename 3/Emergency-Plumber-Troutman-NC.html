<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.
