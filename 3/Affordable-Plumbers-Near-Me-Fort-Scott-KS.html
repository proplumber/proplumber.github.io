<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
