<p>Odd Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. Because of the tight space, the pipes typically make strange gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the strange noises originating from your sink.</p>
