The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.
