<p>Depending upon your situation, your plumber might utilize one or a combination of piping material throughout your house repiping job. Copper is basic due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is difficult to install, which implies higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which suggests plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which conserves money and time and reduces the threat of joint leaks. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping process. Copper piping and PEX piping are used since of their safety, cost and performance. Copper piping prevents bacteria from growing within the pipe supplying healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both flexible and light-weight. This product is resistant against deterioration and will help improve water pressure.</p>
