<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
