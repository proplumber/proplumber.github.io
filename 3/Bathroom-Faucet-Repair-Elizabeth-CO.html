<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our License page for more information on getting a license. As soon as you obtain a license you can commence with the work. However, you need to require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Never stress over surprise costs or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We provide affordable flat-rate costs on all our services. The house still had lead pipes. Houses built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
