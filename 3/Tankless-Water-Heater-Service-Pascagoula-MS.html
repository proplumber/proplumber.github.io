<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
