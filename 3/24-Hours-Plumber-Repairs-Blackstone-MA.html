In some instances, resins can not be cleaned of pollutants and will need to be replaced. (This should not hold true if the resin is regularly regenerated and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
