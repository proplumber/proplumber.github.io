<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
