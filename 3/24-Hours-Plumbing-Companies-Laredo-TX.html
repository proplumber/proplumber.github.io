<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Rejected strategies should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
