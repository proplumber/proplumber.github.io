The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
