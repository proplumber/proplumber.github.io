<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
