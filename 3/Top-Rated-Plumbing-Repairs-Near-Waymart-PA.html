Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water system within a building these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to offer one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible issue with the water heater. It can likewise indicate the water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old.
