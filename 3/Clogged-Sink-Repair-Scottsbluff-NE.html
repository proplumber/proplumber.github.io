<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Scottsbluff NE</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
