<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
