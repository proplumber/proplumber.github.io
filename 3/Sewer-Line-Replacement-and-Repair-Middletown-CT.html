<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

Clean the Pipe: In some cases, the very best way to clean out your drains is by cleaning the pipe with a pipe brush. Merely run the brush down the pipe and gently scrub away caked-on gunk.
