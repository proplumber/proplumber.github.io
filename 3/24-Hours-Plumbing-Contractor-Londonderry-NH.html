It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
