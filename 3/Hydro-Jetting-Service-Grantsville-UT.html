<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the option is to repair the broken area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to fix the concern. Other times a more comprehensive solution is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply years of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature level can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
