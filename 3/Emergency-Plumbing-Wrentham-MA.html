<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
