<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
