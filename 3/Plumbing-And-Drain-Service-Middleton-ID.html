Sediment Build-Up: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
