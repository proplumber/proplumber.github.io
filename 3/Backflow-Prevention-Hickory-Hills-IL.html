<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
