<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

Pull the auger out periodically to get rid of particles until it moves past the obstruction without resistance.</p>
