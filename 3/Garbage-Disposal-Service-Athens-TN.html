<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection in between a public water supply or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be repaired by changing that section of damaged piping. Nevertheless, when the problem is found in pipes throughout your home, it may be time to consider whole-house repiping. Couple of property owners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, but managing the task before the plumbing system fails allows you to prevent substantial property damage.</p>
