<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is generally found prior to it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This small hole permits water to continuously leak out extremely gradually. Gradually it can result in a considerable develop of water. Dripped water normally stays under the house and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's structure was not correctly compressed, this can potentially trigger a cavity.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
