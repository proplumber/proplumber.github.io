<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
