<p>Over time, like any other appliance in your home, your waste disposal unit. may need repairs. A disposal system may start or clog to leak through heavy, or improper, usage. A leak someplace in the system may show a used seal. In many cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the entire system. This is where the UPC truly comes into play.

The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
