<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Lots of house owners avoid repiping their homes due to the fact that it is a big task that is typically perceived as an unneeded expenditure. Why repipe your house when repairing it is possible?

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
