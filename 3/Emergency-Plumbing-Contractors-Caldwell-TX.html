<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally directed somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
