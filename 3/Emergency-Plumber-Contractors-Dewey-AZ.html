<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary blockages further down the water lines.

In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow chart is required to guarantee it was repaired properly. A correctly fixed assembly needs to provide years of protection.</p>
