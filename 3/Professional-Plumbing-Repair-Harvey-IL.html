<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is only equipped to handle softer organic waste.

Nevertheless you risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed appropriately (Image 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>

The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to utilize but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
