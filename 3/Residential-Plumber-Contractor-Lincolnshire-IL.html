Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
