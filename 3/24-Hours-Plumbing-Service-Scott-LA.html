Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water system within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
