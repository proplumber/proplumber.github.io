<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
