<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning devices have actually been marketed based upon a variety of claims concerning their effect on water solidity and associated scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not been able to figure out standards for these items and report inconsistent efficiency to date.

<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
