<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide.

If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
