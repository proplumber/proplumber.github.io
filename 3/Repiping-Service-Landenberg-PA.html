<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
