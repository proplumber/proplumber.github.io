<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
