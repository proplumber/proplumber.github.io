<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. The most common drain issue we are required is problems with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is slow to drain. Normally, drainage problems are a sign that there is a clog or build-up inside your drains which needs to be cleaned out.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
