The plan must be drawn to scale or with dimensions showed from walls and all neighboring items.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

Our Utah Plumbers install brand-new basements additions, bathroom remodels, and more. For customers that wish to cut down on their water costs or water use, Beehive Plumbing can advise on installing a new low-flow or dual flush toilet.</p>
