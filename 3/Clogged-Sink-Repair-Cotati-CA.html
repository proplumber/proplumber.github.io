<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
