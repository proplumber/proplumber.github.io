<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
