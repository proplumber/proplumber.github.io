<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
