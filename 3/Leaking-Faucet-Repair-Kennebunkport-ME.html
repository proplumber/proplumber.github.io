<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
