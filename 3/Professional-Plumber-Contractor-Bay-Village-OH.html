<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test.
