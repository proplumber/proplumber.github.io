<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Valencia Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the shop.
