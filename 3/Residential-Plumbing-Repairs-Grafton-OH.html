Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up.
