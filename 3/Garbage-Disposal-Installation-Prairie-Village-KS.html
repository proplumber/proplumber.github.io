<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.
