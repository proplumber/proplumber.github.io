A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
