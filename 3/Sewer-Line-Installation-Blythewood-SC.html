<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
