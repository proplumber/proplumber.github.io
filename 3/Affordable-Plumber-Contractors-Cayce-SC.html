<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their workers). The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>In many cases, a natural gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This kind of scenario might occur if a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line.
