<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes.

All this is dependent on having a running hot water heater. If you summarize all that demand, it is simple to see the pressure placed on the heater.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
