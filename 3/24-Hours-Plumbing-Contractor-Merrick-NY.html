Once it has actually passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan developed to prevent the reversal of the flow of water. The two kinds of pipes that we choose to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two very different materials, however they both have incredible sturdiness and durability.</p>
