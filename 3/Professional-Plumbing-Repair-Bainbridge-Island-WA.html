<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
