<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. You may need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
