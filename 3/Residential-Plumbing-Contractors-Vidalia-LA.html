<h3>Sewer Line Cleaning in Vidalia Louisiana</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
