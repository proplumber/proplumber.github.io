<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Cape Girardeau MO 63701?</h3>
<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
