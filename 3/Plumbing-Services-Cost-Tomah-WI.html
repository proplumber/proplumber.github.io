<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high price makes it impractical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, consist of phosphates that damage the environment.
