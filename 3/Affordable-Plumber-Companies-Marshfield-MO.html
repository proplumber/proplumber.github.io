Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other important aspect needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
