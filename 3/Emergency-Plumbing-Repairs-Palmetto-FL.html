<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
