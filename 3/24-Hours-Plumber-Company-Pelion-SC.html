<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Pelion SC</h3>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
