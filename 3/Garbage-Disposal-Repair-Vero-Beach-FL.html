<p>On and off does any structural damage occur as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally spotted before it triggers any substantial damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This little hole permits water to constantly leak out extremely slowly. In time it can result in a significant build of water.
