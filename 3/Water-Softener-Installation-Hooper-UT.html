<p>Did you know that your kitchen sink is among the most used items in your house? Washing meals is just the beginning. Stop and think of that for a minute.

Repeated use may mean you experience problems.</p>
<p>When used in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their home.
