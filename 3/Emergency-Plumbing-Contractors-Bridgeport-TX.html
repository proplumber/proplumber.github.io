<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a new or refurbished structure is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can trigger damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

The intent of electrical inspection is to make sure compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to lower individual, and structural electrical hazards.
