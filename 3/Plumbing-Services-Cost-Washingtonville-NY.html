<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
