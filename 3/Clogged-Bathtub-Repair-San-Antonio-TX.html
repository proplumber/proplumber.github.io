<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>All faucets and valves in your house need to be regularly exercised to keep them from freezing in location. For instance, a single handle shower valve may end up being mineralized and calcified triggering it to not operate correctly when called upon. Just like you and me, routine workout keeps our bodies working at a greater level than if we sat not doing anything every day. Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your home, check the valves throughout your home, and encourage you of any choices or possible repairs that need to be thought about now or in the future.
