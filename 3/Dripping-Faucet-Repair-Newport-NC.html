<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable.

The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
