<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction impact and draw possible impurities into the potable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are frequently found in most homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
