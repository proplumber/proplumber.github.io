Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes.

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.
