<p>5. Pour hot water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a little bit of warm water. Whether tree roots have actually made their way into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never ever an enjoyable experience. Fortunately, you do not constantly need the help of a professional to fix it.</p>
