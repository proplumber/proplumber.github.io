<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>
<p>One typical way for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
