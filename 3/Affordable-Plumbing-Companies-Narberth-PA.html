<p>3. Solar Salt originates from vaporized seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink film is actually a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. As soon as the brand-new salt has had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
