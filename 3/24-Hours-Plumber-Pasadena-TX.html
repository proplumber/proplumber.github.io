<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
