<p>Having your plumbing regularly examined is an essential element of preventative maintenance.

As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
