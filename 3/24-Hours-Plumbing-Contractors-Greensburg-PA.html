<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
