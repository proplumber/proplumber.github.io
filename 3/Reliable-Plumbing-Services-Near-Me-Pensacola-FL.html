<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when utilized in battling a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention concerns.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
