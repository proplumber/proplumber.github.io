It has actually remained in place given that your house was built so it is about the exact same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and deterioration. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. Several homes in my community being repiped and have actually spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't discovered quickly.</p>
<p>A well-trained plumber would not suggest a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may suggest moving toilets to different restrooms to lessen any future interruptions.
