<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the solidity of Woodbury's water. Since it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates, firmness can appear as a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip.

<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
