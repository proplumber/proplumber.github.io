<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Odessa FL</h3>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
