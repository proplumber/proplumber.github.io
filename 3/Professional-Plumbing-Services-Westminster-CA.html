<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of eliminating bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly priorities for a municipality and its residents but hard water can negatively impact faucets and home appliances in a house.

Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
