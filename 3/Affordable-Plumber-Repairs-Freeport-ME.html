<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
