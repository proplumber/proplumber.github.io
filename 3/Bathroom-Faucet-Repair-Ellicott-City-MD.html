<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally important to developing a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a building these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up.

This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems remains detached from clean" water.</p>
