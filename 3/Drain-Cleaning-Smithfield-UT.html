<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, normally salt. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered extremely low salt" by the Fda.</p>
