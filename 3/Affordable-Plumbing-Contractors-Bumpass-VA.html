<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

The issue with any leak or drip with a faucet is determining the root source. Sometimes the leak or drip will be brought on by a harmed faucet, worn out seals or washers, wore away -rings and gaskets, or parts that are simply too old and need to be replacement.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
