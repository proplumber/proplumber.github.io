<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Salem OH</h3>
<p>The Plumbers Connection can unclog your storm drain systems with using a hydrojetting machine. The hydrojet has a spinning head on the head that launches a very high pressure stream of water. The quickly swirling water has the ability to jet" through the most difficult of clogs consisting of mud, leaves, branches, garbage and more. The end outcome is a storm drain system that is free and clean of particles and ready for service.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
