The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. As soon as the brand-new salt has had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>Typically, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll notice the same problems cropping up again and again, even though you have actually had them fixed.
