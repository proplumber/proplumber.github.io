<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Schenectady NY</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
