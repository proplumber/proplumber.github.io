The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
