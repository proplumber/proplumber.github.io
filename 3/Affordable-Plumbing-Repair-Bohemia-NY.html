<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water triggers the heater and water is heated up as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Because they can hamper the blades, cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal. Finally, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
