<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

Nevertheless, hard water can cause everything from small inconveniences, like areas on dishes or soap scum, to significant problems like a much shorter life expectancy for your water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your house.</p>
