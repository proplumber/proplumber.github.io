<p>New models of garbage disposals may need to be hard-wired into a dedicated electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't readily available in an older home, hiring an electrical contractor to add a circuit costs around $150-$ 250.

Instead, call a plumber to locate and clear the clog without damaging your waste disposal unit.</p>

Bonney Plumbing is the one to call if your existing instantaneous hot water system or faucet ever requires repair. We offer complete immediate hot water system repair.

Items that would otherwise enter the garbage should not be placed in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
