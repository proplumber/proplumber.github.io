<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Gypsum CO</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very rare cases where the building is deemed to not posture a threat to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
