<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Aberdeen SD 57401</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
