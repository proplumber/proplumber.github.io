<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Mukilteo</h2>

There is one more device Hose Vacuum Breaker (HVB) which should be set up on all garden hose bibs to prevent polluted lawn water being sucked in to the drinking water system network. It is a little brass unit that can be directly threaded on to the hose bib.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
