<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
