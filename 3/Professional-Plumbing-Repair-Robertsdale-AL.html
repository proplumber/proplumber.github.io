Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Also, rust of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
