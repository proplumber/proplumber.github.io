The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
