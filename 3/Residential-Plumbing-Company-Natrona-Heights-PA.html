Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
