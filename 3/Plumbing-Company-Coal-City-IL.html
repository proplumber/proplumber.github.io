<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
