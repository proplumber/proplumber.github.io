<p>When gas burns incompletely, Carbon monoxide is launched. The symptoms are the exact same as exposure to gas leak. The exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 individuals passed away from carbon monoxide gas poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this disaster, make sure to utilize your gas ranges precisely as advised and never ever to use them to warm your house.
