It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
