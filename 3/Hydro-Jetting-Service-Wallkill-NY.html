<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You have permanent water hardness if you do not see limescale build-up but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as effectively or your skin getting itchy and sensitive. Do not try to find the leak if you smell gas. Rather, leave your home or building right away. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might create a spark. When you are in a safe location, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
