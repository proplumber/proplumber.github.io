<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the water supply pipes in a house or building. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of installing a brand-new water line plumbing system. This procedure generally includes eliminating old readily accessible pipes and then setting up the new plumbing system.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
