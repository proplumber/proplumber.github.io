<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see but rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the service technician to properly examine conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection allows us to make a notified decision regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the best solution as well. We can make the ideal recommendation with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of clogs or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
