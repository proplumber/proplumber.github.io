<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
