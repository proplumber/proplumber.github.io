Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
