<p>Depending on your circumstance, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping material throughout your house repiping project. Copper is basic since it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is difficult to install, which means higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves time and money and minimizes the risk of joint leakages. PEX also withstands rust and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending upon your needs.</p>
