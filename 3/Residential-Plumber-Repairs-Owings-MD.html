<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Owings MD</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
