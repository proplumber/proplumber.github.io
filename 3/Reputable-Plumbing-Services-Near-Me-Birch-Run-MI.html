<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal is available in 2 basic types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover remain in place to run the system. Continuous feed prevails and the most convenient to use; a batch feed design is much safer however can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste since you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
