<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

It's easy and quick and more affordable than working with a plumber.</p>
