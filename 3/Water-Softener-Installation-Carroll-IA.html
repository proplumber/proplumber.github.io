<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
