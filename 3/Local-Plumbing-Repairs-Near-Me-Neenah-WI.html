<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the makeup water, backpressure is created.
