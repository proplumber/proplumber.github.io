<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
