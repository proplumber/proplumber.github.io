<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.
