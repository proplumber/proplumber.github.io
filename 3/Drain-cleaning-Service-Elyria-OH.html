<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it concerns pipe repair, the most pricey factors aren't the equipment or products used, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
