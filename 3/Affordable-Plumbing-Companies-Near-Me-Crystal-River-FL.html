<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
