<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its steep price makes it unwise as a household solution.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
