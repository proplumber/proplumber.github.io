Your backflow preventer failed the annual inspection and needs to be fixed or replaced and re-certified within thirty days. Call a certified plumber immediately and have the plumber contact the Cross Connection Control workplace. Traditional tank hot water heater: These water heaters are usually powered by natural gas or electrical power. They hold 20 to 100 gallons of water, depending on the requirements of your household.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.

Often times easy repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a fixed price of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13.
