For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water products.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container underneath the area to capture water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
