<p>You are accountable for replacing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the annual test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly must satisfy the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
