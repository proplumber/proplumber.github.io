<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly helpful in finding a problem.</p>
