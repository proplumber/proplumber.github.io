<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great man. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70.
