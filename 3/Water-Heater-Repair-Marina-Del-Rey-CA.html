<p>In truth, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this sort of water leaves behind.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
