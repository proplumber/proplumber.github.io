Rather, our technicians use a bursting tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair method is generally utilized to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>

Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>
