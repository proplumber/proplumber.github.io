Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
