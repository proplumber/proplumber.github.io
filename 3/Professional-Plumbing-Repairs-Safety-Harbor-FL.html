<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Safety Harbor FL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
