<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to consider. Energy Effectiveness. Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy performance of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF).

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
