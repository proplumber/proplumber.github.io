<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
