<p>Old, worn, or harmed plumbing pipes can cause significant problems. Even small leakages can slowly dampen walls and floorings until they end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might end up being corroded and add rust to the water system. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a great sign. Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to address this concern. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
