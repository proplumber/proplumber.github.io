<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
