<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain during backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you might not desire simply running outside. Not to mention plumbing code might be violated without correct backflow prevention.</p>
