<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

Each flexible earthquake shut-off valve averages in between $100 and $300, and the typical labor cost to install one is likewise $100 and $300. Many property owners ultimately notice hair or soap scum accumulating in their sinks. When not right away remedied, the stopper or drain may become obstructed. As any house owner will understand, clogged drains aren't the only problems that can plague bathroom sinks and faucets.</p>
