<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
