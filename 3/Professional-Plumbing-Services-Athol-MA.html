Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long enduring and resilient, copper is the industry requirement.
