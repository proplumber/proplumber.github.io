It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
