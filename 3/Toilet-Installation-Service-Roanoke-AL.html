<p>Gas leaks are typically found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas devices. If you use liquid meal soap to the suspected area, a quick way to find a gas leak is. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and need to instantly get in touch with a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
