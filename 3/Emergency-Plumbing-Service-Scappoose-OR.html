<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
