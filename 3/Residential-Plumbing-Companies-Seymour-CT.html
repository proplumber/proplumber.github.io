A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
