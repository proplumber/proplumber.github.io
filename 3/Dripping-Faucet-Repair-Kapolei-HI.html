<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
