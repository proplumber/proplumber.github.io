<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat defense assembly.</p>
