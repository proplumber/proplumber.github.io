<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately becomes a severe security threat.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
