<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
