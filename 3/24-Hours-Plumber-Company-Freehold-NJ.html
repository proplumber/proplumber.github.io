TLC's drain professionals are qualified and experienced in carrying out drain and sewer line inspections for houses. We offer video inspections so buyers and sellers can get an extensive analysis of the drain system.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source available to attain that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome suggest that the level of defense on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high risk security level.</p>
