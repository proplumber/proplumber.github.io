<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
