<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation might still occur.</p>
