<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Transforming your home to gas, or if the current line is at capacity, you'll need to install a new gas line from the street to your house.
