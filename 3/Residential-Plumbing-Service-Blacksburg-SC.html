<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Blacksburg SC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
