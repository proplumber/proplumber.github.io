<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Whether you're a property owner, company owner, or residential or commercial property manager, at some time you will probably need to call a plumber. It's a good concept to do a little research into the world of plumbing prior to you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can save your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst problem in regards to concerns that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Hot water is important, so don't take possibilities with a handyman or a Do It Yourself project. The professionals at HRI plumbing can examine your current system and supply affordable options that will conserve you cash and provide endless warm water for all of your requirements for your house or business in Jacksonville, Springfield, Taylorville, New Berlin, Pleasant Plains, IL and the surrounding area.</p>
