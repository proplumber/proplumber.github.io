Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
