<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
