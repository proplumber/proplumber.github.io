<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller sized design that operated on the same concept however could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
