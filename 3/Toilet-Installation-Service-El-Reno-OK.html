Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
