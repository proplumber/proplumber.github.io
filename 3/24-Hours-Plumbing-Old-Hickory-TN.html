<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode.

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
