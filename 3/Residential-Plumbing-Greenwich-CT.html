<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
