I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>Unforeseen modifications in water pressure could possibly be due to deterioration and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through.

<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can become worn and corroded, resulting in leaks. Depending upon the intensity of the scenario, just one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and changed. Components involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
