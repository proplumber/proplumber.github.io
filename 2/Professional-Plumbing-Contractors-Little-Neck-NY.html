For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.

While most plumbers expect payment on the day of service, or in a prompt manner once they have actually sent an invoice, numerous plumbing contractors need that you pay a deposit upfront.
