<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
