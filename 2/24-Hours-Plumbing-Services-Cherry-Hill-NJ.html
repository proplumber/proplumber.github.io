<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
