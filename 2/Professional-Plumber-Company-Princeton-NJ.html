However the truth is that water softening simply gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
