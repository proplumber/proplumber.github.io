If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue.
