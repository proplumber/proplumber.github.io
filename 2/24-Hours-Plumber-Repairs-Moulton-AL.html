<p>Each component of the assembly must be evaluated to determine what is in need of repair. The field test may not constantly show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are necessary.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains.
