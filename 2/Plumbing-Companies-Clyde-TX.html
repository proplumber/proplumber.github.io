<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can help relieve those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.
