<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>

When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, blocking them.
