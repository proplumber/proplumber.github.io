<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
