<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly easy system, in spite of their significance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your organisation, where irrigation meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and avoid any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices.
