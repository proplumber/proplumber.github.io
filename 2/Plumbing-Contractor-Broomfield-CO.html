<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Broomfield CO</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
