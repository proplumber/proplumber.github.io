<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you get in touch with a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is extremely harmful and can present severe health dangers.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
