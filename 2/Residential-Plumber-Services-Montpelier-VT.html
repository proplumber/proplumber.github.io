<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you get in touch with a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your house.
