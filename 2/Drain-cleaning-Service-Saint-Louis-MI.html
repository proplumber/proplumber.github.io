<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
