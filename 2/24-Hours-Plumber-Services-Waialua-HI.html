<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, including bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and rust.

In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
