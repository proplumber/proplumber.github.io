<p>The best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it enters into the house. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies. Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal.
