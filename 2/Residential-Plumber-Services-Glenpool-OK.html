Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through improvement or pipe replacement?
