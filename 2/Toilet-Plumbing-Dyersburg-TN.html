<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Dyersburg TN</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
