<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
