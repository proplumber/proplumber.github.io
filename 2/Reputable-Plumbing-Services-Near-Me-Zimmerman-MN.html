<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist switched off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, meanwhile, carried out nearly along with on the day they were installed.</p>
