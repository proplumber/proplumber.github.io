When it rains, any excess water is expected to decrease a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
