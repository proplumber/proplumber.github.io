<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You should also examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep cost makes it not practical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in many cases, consist of phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
