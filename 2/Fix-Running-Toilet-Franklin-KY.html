Rather, our specialists use a rupturing tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate. A new pipeline is immediately drawn in and fills in the void produced by the old, burst pipe in a commercial or residential sewer. This repair approach is normally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>
