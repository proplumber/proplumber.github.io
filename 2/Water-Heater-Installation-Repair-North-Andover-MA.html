<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dose, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an influence on cleaning agent savings. The research study consisted of tests that removed tough soils, in addition to examining filming and spotting.

That cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property.

This can create cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome imply that the level of protection on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high risk protection level.</p>
