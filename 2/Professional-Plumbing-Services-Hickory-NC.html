<h3>Water Heater Service in Hickory North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Unexpected changes in water pressure could possibly be because of deterioration and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll more than likely notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes. The best solution is to replace your plumbing with brand-new pipes that don't have accumulation.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. This type of camera is especially helpful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
