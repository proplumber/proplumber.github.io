<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
