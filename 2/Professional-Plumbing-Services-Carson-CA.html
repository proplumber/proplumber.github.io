<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Carson CA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>To make it easy, homeowners with testable backflow devices are supposed to have them tested by a certified tester every year. The most typical testable backflow device discovered at Minnesota houses is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is discovered on nearly every residential yard irrigation system (aka sprinkler system), shown below.</p>
