<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
