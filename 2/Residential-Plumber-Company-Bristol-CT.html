<p>Frequently brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may activate periodically, as well.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
