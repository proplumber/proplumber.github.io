<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in truth, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating flavor lots of people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the system). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you might not desire simply running outside. Not to point out plumbing code might be broken without correct backflow prevention.</p>
