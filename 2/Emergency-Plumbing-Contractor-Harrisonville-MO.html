Some electrical knowledge is needed to make sure the wires are disconnected properly. Response: No!

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
