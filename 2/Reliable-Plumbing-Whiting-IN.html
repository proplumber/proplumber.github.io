<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing supplies repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, in addition to cities and towns in the surrounding city. If you notice rusty water, rumbling or banging noises originating from your hot water heater's tank, an increased amount of time needed to heat your water, or puddles of water under your water heater, it's time to call the specialists about repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
