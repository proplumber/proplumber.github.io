<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Easley SC</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
