When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

It may not work extremely well all the time, but you can't tell if that's regular or not. Plus, there's that omnipresent but never ever unacknowledged feeling that it's you-you're somehow doing something wrong in there.</p>
