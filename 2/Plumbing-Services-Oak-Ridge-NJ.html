<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
