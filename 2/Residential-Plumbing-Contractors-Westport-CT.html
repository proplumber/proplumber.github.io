If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your home was constructed decades prior to that.</p>
