<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
