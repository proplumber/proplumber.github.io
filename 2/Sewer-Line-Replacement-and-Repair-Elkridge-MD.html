<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
