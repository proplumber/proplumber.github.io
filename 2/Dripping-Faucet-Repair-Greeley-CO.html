You probably don't wish to collect your outdoor patio, parking area or landscape.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is just equipped to manage softer natural waste. If bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work effectively. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
