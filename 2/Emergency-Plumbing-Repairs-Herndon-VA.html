<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
