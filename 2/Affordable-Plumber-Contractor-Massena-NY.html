You, for that reason, have to utilize more and more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
