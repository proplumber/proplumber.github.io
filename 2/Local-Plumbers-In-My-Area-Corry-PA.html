A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.
