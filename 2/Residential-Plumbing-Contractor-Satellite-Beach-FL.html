<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
