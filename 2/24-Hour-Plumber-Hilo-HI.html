<p>Hydro jetting works by blasting extremely pressurized water through your sewer line, and it is considerably more effective and affordable than alternative approaches of minimizing obstruction in sewer lines. It's so reliable in reality, that Northwest Drain Station uses a no dig-up guarantee.

<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
