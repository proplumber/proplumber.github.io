<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
