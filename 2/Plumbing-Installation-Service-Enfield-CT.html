This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
