Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Senoia GA 30276</h3>
<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
