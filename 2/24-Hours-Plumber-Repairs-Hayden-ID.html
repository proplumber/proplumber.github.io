<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
