<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The great news is that it doesn't always need a repair of your whole system if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

Damaged sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and costly repairs.</p>
