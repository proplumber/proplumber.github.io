<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
