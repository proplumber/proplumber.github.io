<p>Some house owners may think about water softeners as a high-end product, something that's great to have" however not altogether needed. Nevertheless, difficult water can trigger whatever from small annoyances, like spots on meals or soap scum, to major problems like a shorter lifespan for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other vital house devices.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
