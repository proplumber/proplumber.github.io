<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>You have to invest at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient finish system. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
