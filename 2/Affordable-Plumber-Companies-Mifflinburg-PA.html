<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
