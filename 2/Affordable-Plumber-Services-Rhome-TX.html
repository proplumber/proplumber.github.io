<p>If a gas water heater or an electric system is more cost-efficient, house owners typically ask. The answer depends upon your house. While gas models are less costly to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electric water heater is generally lower, however it can be more costly to run. Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
