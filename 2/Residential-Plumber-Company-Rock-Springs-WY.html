<p>Homeowners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when buying a brand-new home.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification.
