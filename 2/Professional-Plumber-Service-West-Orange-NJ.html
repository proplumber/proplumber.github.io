<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
