<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Grand Island NE</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
