It truly isn't a great concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not disperse your weight evenly and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
