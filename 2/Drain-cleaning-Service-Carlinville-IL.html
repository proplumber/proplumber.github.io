These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
