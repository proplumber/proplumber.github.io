<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally carried somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat areas of pipe that can be susceptible to clogging due to the fact that there simply isn't enough a high enough flow to eliminate the particles.</p>
