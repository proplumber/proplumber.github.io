It can take a DIYer a lot of time to locate and complete basic repairs, so consider that with the cost when attempting to deal with the issue by yourself. The reason a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can detect the problem and repair it.</p>
