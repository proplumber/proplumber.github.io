<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
