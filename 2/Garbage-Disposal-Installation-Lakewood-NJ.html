<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to achieve their goal, but fire department vehicles typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bath tubs to a local water treatment center.

That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the competence to identify an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
