It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Today, most professionals recommend a cautious inspection of residential hot water heater regularly - a minimum of every year. Malfunctioning water heaters cause a variety of problems. These problems run the gamut from slow or unreliable water heating to pricey water leakages and potential fire hazards.
