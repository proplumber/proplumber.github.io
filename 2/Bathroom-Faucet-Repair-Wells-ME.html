<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating provides a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can result in a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger considerable problems and damage-- particularly typical in older houses. Utilizing a sewer camera to check the weak locations or clog, our highly trained specialists can rapidly find the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- effectively carrying wastewater to your septic system or municipal system.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
