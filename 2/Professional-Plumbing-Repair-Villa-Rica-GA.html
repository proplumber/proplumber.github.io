<p>The excellent news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole unit if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they lead to small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Many plumbing concerns involve stoppages and clogged drains or pipes. If all of your DIY efforts do not work, blockages in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets may be covered by an American Home Shield plumbing guarantee depending on the cause. When you encounter a covered plumbing problem, no matter how big or how little, contact AHS for aid.</p>
