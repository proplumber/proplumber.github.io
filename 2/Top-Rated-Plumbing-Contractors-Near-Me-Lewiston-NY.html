For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.
