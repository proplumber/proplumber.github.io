There are a few food items you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
