You might be thinking that it doesn't make sense to use a pipe that reacts with water as your house's main source of water transportation, and you would be proper. However, when the majority of these pipes were being set up, nobody knew this was going to be the outcome. Thankfully, there are a lot of other piping alternatives nowadays including copper.</p>
