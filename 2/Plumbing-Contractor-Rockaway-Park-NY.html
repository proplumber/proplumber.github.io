<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you choose should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
