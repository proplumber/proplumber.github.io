<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>There are health and safety dangers one must avoid while working on a sewer line task. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and might expose employees throughout the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig strikes a gas line, breathing the gas can hurt your body, and there is a threat of fire or explosion damage to your home or your next-door neighbor's. Another risk in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your security and health are too important to run the risk of in a DIY sewer task! Avoid these safety threats by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
