<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure.

<p>Quality sinks correctly installed last for decades, so we're usually called in for kitchen and bath remodels. But with discolorations or scratches in a kitchen sink along with chipped or broken porcelain in bathroom sinks many house owners pick a sink installation alone. Fixtures and sinks might also establish drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also consist of adjusting or replacing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
