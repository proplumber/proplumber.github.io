<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Queensbury NY</h3>
<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
