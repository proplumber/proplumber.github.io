<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Braintree MA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
