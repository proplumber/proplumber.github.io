<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is another crucial aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, but simple to treat. It utilizes salt to remove odors and minerals found in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that bring in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
