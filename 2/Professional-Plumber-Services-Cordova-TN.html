It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>

According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low salt" by the Fda.</p>
