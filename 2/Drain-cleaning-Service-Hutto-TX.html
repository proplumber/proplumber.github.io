<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Storage tank water heaters are the most typical, and are run with gas. Their style consists of an insulated tank where water is warmed and kept until needed. Gas water heaters are more energy effective and operating costs are lowered by about 50 percent, compared to electric water heaters. Storage tank water heaters have a greater initial cost than electrical.</p>

<p>House owners often ask if a gas water heater or an electrical system is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your home. While gas designs are more economical to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical water heater is usually lower, however it can be more pricey to run. Electric ranges are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
