<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
