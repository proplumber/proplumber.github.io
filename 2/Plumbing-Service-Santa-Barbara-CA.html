The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
