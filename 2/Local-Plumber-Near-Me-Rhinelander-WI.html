Infant baths, family pet baths, watering plants, food preparation, preparation for entertaining, hand washing fragile items, and mopping just among others tasks. Recurring use might imply you experience problems.</p>

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
