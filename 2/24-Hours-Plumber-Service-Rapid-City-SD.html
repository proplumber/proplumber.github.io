<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
