He noted that there are particular contaminants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can assist minimize those concerns. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>
