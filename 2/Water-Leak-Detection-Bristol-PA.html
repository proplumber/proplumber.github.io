<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
