Some homeowners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are generally short-lived fixes that do not provide irreversible resolutions.</p>
