<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
