The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight evenly and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
