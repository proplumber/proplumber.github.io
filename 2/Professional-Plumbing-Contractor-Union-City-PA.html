<p>Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your house.

Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>If you see nothing apparent, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist right and left. Examine that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button if the motor spins freely. If these measures do not work, and your disposer's service warranty has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
