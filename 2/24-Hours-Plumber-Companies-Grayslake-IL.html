<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise cause jams and blockages - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside.

<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you wish to try the gentlest method possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's easily offered at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
