<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
