<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
