<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electrical hot water heater and tankless water heaters. Carefully flex the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that doesn't have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the experts at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize squandered water.</p>
