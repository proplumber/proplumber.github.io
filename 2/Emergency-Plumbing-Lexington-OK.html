Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
