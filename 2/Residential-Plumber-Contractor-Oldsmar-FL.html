<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
