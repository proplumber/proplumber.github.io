Making use of these products is called chemigation. There are a number of components to this valve. The check valve has a spring operated flapper, which permits flow in just one instructions. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last component is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are presented to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or static circulation condition may cause annoyance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
