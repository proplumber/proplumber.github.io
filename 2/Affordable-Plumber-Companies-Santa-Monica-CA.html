The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
