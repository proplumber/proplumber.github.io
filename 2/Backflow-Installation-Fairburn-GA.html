Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
