<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Phenix City AL 36867</h3>

Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
