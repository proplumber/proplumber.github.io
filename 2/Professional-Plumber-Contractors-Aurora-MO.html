<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
