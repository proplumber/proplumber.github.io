<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
