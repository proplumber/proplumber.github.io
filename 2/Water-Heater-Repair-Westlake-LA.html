<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no unfavorable impacts and are, in truth, vital daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating flavor many individuals find desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and detergents.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
