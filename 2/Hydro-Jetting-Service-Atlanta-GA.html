If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.
