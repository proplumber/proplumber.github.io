<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
