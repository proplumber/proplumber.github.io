<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Greenwood MS</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a danger to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
