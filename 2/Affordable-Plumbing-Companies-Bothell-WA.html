<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
