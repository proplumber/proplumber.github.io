<p>The calcium from limestone is the major contributor to the firmness of Woodbury's water. Solidity can appear as an annoyance when water is boiled or dried from a drip because it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes. It also interferes with soap and cleaning agent usage. People with very soft water can utilize smaller amounts of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes three to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon home's size and the company doing the work. Wood advises inspecting the certifications of different companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They stay the least expensive and most reliable way to rid your water of frustrating minerals.</p>
