Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
