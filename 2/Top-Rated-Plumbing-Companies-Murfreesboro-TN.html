Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
