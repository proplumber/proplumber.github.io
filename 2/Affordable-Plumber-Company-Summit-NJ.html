<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might utilize one or a combination of piping material throughout your house repiping task. Copper is basic because it's lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is hard to install, which indicates greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which means plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves time and money and lowers the risk of joint leaks. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>
