<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
