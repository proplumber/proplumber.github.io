<p>The normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
