<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
