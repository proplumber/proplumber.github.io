<p>When the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
