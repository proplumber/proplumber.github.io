<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
