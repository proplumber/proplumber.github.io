Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products containing harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
