Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of corrosion.</p>
