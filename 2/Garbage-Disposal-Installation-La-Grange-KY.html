<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly should be checked to determine what needs repair.
