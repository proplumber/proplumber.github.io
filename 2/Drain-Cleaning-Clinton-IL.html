<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a new or renovated structure is installed by well-informed artisans in accordance with applicable codes.

Clogs in a component can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
