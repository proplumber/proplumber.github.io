<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for decades, so we're usually hired for kitchen and bath remodels. However with stains or scratches in a kitchen sink in addition to cracked or broken porcelain in bathroom sinks many house owners choose a sink installation alone. Fixtures and sinks might also develop drain problems that require a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also consist of adjusting or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
