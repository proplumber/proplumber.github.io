<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

A great deal of sink clogs that happen are much deeper than you might think, and the severity is so serious that a typical store-bought drain cleaner or impromptu house drain cleaning remedy can not fix.</p>
