It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
