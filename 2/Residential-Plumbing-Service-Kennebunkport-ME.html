<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be fixed with the best RO system.</p>
