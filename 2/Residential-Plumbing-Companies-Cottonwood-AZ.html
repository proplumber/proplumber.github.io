<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
