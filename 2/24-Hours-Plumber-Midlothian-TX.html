<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Midlothian TX 76065</h3>
<p>If you've always resided in an area with hard water, you might not realize how much it affects you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Tough water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>

Difficult water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits remaining. This makes chores much easier and less frustrating for everyone included.</p>
