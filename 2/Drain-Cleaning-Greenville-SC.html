An authorized backflow prevention device, which should be checked yearly, should be set up on the service connection that the department has actually determined as having a capacity for backflow.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
