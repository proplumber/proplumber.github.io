<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
