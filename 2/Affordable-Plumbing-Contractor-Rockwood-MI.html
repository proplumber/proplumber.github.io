It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
