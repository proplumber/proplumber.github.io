<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
