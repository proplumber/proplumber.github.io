<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Papillion NE</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer selection consists of hose connection vacuum breakers, atmospheric vacuum breakers, double check valves and vented dual check valves. Each backflow preventer is tested for performance and performance before leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory. This dedication to quality has actually made us one of the most relied on names in the market.</p>
