It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly expensive, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.
