<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Schertz TX</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not posture a threat to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
