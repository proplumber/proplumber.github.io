<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
