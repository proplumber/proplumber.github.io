<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Concord MA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
