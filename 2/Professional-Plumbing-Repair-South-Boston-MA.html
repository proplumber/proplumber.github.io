A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
