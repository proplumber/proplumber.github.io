<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
