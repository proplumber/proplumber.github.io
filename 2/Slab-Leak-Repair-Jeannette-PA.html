<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
