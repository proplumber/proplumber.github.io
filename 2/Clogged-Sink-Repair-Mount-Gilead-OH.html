<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
