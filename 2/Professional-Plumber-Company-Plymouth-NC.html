<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Plymouth NC</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>
