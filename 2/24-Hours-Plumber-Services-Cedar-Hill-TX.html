<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
