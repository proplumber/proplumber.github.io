A quick method to spot a gas leak is if you use liquid meal soap to the suspected area. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and should right away contact a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas.

Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
