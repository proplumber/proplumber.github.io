<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks consisting of water pipe and supply pipelines. Water pipe range in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines offer water for whole areas along with big commercial, residential and industrial complexes. Depending on the flow capacity, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter reinforced concrete.</p>
