<p>One common way for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>If you've ever been irritated by cloudy white spots on your dishes that won't disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to know that water softening can remove these problems and more.

This makes chores simpler and less frustrating for everyone involved.</p>
