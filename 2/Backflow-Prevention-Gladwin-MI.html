<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Gladwin MI 48624?</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to go through. Because of the tight area, the pipes frequently make unusual gurgling noises as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and after that switch on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing group finishes the job rapidly and affordably.</p>
