Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
