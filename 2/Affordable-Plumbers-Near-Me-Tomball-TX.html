<p>You might have heard stories about a warm water heater taking off inside a home or business! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into an unsafe time bomb.

A conventional tank water heater typically lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with correct maintenance and care. It may be best for your long-term costs to replace it now if your unit is getting up there in age.</p>
