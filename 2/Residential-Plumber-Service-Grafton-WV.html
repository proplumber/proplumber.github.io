<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are interesting in protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome mean that the level of defense on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high threat defense level.</p>

For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure.
