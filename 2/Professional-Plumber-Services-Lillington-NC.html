<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure.

A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
