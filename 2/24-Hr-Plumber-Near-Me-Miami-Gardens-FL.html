<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 available techniques. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs gradually. Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose.
