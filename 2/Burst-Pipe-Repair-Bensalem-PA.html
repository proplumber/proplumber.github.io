<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
