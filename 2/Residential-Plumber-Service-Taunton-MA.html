<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

It is seldom utilized today for new building residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
