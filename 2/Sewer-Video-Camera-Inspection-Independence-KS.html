<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
