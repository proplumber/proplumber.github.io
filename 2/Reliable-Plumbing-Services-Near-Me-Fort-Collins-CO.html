<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, joists, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
