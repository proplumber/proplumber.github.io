<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

An unusual, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever an excellent sign. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to resolve this concern. Call a plumber right away.</p>
