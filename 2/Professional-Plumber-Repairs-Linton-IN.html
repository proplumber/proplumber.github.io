<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
