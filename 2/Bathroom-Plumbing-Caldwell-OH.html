<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
