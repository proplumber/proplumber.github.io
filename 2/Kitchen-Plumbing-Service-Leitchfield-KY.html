These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your unit is at the end of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your hot water heater really rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
