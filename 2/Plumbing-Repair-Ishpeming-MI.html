<p>Examine the house's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and available for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration.</p>
