<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham.
