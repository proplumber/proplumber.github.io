Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
