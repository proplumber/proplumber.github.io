<p>Clogged toilets are among the most typical plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
