It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
