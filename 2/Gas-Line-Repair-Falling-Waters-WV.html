<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing annual forward flow tests are often viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>It generally represents rust and mineral buildup if you observe low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>Some consumers like to have softer water and choose to install a water softening system. Again, it's individual preference and totally up to the private consumer. If you see any of these indications to have a Rainaldi plumbing professional check your water lines or pipes before its too late, contact us right away. Our check-up, integrated with a preventive maintenance schedule, will ensure your plumbing and drainage systems are working effectively. In reality, our plumbers can even install an auto-injection system which can get rid of pricey grease-related problems that cause slow and stopped drains.</p>
