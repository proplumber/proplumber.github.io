As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
