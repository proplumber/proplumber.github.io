<p>Turn the handle counterclockwise if it ends up being hard to turn; it's most likely you have actually encountered a clog. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain till you hit resistance again, then turn the handle back and forth to work a few of the clog complimentary. Pull the auger out periodically to get rid of particles until it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing concerns plumbers deal with, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop.
