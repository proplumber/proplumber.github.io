<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are some of the most important features of a business. Clients can leave your organisation with an unfavorable impression if urinals and toilets do not operate correctly.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
