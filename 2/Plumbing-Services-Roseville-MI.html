<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
