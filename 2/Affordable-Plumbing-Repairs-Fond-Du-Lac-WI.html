<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Companies in Fond Du Lac</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is by hand manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the technician to properly analyze conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection enables us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the best option too. If the pipe needs to be cleaned of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence.</p>
