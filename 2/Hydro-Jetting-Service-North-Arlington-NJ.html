<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
