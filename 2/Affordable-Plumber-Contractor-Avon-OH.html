<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
