Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Elizabethtown KY 42701</h3>
<p>Whether you're dealing with a leaky faucet, a broken toilet or a leaking or burst water line, residential and commercial plumbing issues can really slow you down. The pros at Perez Plumbing have the equipment, experience and understanding to quickly handle any plumbing problem you may have. With years of plumbing contractor experience, our extremely trained experts bring functional and affordable plumbing solutions to home and business owners in the area.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>When we manage your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can unwind and use your gas piping without any worry. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's likewise an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners want to get their hands filthy with. It requires more than simply effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the trouble is typically due to how frustrating it is to evaluate the damage. This is even more problematic if the damage is irreparable or requires more extensive repair, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
