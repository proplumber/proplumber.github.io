<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak.

If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
