Waste disposal unit minimize household refuse by grinding it up and sending it into the sewer system. They are hassle-free and become an ignored item of convenience in the house.

<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
