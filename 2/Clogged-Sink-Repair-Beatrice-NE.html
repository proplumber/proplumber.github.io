<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening up any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can certainly be a big endeavor, which is why the service is only performed when definitely essential. Initially, your plumber will decide which piping material to utilize for the job, either copper or plastic. Replacing and installing brand-new pipes can take anywhere in between 3-5 days depending on the size of your house.</p>
<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't necessarily need a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
