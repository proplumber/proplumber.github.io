<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
