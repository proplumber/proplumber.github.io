<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction impact and draw possible pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in the majority of houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
