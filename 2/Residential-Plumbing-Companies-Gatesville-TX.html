Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
