<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Ossining NY</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you utilize PEX, copper, or another material. Replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is very important because of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down over the years. Galvanized pipe is made by finishing steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, many times in concrete. It is rather typical to leave the old pipes in place after disconnecting them. The new pipe is simply installed in the path of least resistance. Depending on the design of your home, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>
