<p>The best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure decreasing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters into the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can likewise help to save water as fixtures in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs are subject to routine and initial testing and maintenance requirements to verify their continued functional efficiency. Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific details is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items containing severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
