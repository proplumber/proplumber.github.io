<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Medford OR</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
