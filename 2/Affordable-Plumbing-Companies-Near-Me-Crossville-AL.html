<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for many building and construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

When water is warmed, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these symptoms.</p>
