<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
