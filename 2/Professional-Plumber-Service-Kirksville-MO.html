<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place?

<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the specialist to accurately examine conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection permits us to make a notified choice relating to the condition of your pipes and advise the very best option as well.

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
