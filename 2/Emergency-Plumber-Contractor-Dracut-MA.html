<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to think about. Energy Efficiency. Selecting a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more effective the water heater the greater the EF ranking. However, even if a hot water heater has a higher EF worth, it doesn't constantly mean it will have lower operating expense. You also need to consider the fuel source.</p>
