<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
