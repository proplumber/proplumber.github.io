<p>Surface Area Accelerated Crystallization is a development that mimics biomineralization, the mechanism frequently recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by utilizing exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of short-lived hardness in water.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
