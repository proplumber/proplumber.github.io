<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the issue. Other times a more extensive option is needed: repiping.</p>

When you connect the P-trap, also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
