<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.
