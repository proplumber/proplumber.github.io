<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is considered to not posture a threat to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
