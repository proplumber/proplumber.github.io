In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
