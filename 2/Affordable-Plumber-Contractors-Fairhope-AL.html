A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without restraining water circulation. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
