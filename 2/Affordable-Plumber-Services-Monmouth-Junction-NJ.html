Backflow is the turnaround of the flow of water in the plumbing system. When the pressure in the water main or a home's plumbing system changes, it can happen. If your toilet is overruning, then you have a clog in the drain line someplace. The initial step would be to clear the clog which you might need a professional plumber for.</p>
<p>Because of the fundamental design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or static circulation condition might cause problem dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
