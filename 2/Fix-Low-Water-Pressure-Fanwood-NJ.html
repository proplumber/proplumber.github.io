<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Fanwood NJ</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
