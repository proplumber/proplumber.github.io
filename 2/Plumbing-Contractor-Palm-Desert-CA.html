<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It typically suggests wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this takes place. Leaks can be unclean and will also eventually cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
