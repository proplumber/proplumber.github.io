<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. It normally shows wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up when this occurs. If you consider what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unhygienic and will also ultimately trigger pressure on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray.
