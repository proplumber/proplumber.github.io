<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
