<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Highlands TX 77562</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may carry unclean water or other, hazardous substances into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
