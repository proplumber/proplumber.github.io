For commercial property, the District reviews making use of each new renter. The correction must be made prior to water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
