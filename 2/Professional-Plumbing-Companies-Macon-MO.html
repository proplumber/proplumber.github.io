<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
