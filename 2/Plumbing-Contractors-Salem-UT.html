Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
