<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced.
