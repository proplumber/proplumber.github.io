<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to provide decades of protection. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then get in the potable water supply. The very best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Supplied there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be fixed, however is it worth fixing? Only after responding to the following concerns should you address repair or replace. Do you understand the number of years old your water heater is? Do you understand how many years it's rated for? If it is close to the variety of years the water heater was rated for, think about replacement rather of repair.</p>
