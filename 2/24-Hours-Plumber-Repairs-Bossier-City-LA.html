<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Bossier City</h2>

<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification.
