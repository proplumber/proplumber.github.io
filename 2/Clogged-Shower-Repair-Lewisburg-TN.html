Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
