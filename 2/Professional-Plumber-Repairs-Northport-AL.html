<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific procedure, but easy to correct. It utilizes salt to eliminate odors and minerals discovered in tough water- most frequently calcium and magnesium.
