<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains ought to be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
