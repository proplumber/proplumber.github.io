<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it.
