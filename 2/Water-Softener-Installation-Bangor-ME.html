In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
