<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place?

<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
