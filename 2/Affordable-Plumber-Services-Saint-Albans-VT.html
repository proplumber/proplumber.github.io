It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
